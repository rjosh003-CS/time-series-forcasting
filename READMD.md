# Time series Forecasting

Time series forecasting for financial markets is a complex task that requires in-depth knowledge and data analysis. In this example, we'll use Python and the statsmodels library to perform time series forecasting using an ARIMA model. You can adapt this code to use other techniques like LSTM or Prophet depending on your preferences and dataset.

In this code:

* We load a simplified synthetic time series dataset with dates and daily stock prices.

* We split the data into training and testing sets, where the training set is used to fit the ARIMA model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

*  We fit an ARIMA model to the training data. You may need to adjust the order parameter based on your data and domain knowledge.

* We make predictions on the test data using the trained ARIMA model.

* We calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as an evaluation metric for the model's accuracy.

* Finally, we plot the original time series, actual prices, and predicted prices for visualization.

To use other techniques like LSTM or Prophet, you'll need to adapt the code accordingly and possibly install additional libraries. Additionally, real-world financial time series data may require more preprocessing and feature engineering.
